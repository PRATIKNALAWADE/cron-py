## PyMotivator

### Introduction
This is a Python program that intends to send motivational quotes on WhatsApp on a daily basis. These quotes are motivational by default but can be changed to funny, sports related, etc if required.

### Purpose
This project has a purpose to learn Python from basics to advanced and at the same time add value by sending/receiving motivational quotes everyday.

### Intended Audience
Anyone who wants to learn Python and its integration with WhatsApp or anyone who wants daily Motivational quotes on WhatsApp.

### Overall Description
This project will have two main modules, one would fetch a quote from a Quote of the Day API
and send a WhatsApp text using a Third Party Service. The other module will be a cron scheduler that will schedule these WhatsApp texts for everyday.

### System Features and Requirements
	Functional Requirements
Python 3.10-dev / 3.8 (For heroku Deployment)
Requests
Twilio
APScheduler
	External Interface Requirements
Quotes of the Day API
Twilio Dashboard for WhatsApp
Visual Studio Code
GitHub
Heroku

	System Features
get_quote_of _the_day
	- takes category as parameter and returns the quote of the day

      -    set_twilio_connection
		- takes account_sid and account_token as parameter and returns client object

      - 	send_whatsapp_text
      		- takes quote and twilio client connection as parameters and returns message ID      

#### background_cron_job
	- takes send_whatsapp_text as a job to execute everyday in background
####  Assumptions and Dependencies
As the service for sending and receiving Quotes depends on Third party applications, it is assumed that they are always Up and Running.
The Project initially aims for learning Python by its latest version i.e 3.10-dev but this version is not available for Heroku hence we would need to downgrade the python version to 3.8 for supporting heroku deployment.
Other Non Functional Requirements
Security - All the keys and passwords to be stored as Environment variables
Quality - Code quality and PEP8 Standards
Performance - Deployment on Heroku for scaling, newer Python version with updated Libraries


Industry Practices
Clean, modularised code
Snake case as per PEP 8
Config is Seperate
Proper Documentation
DRY - Donâ€™t Repeat yourself
